# Instructions

Before the first workshop it's important to at least have a basic working installation of R (the statistical programming language) and RStudio (the most widely-used graphical user interface that allows you to interact with R outside of a command-line environment)

Install instructions will vary a little depending on whether you're on a Mac or Windows

## Windows install:
### R
- navigate to https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
- Click `Download R 4.1.1 for Windows`
- Run the installer
- Test your installation by launching R from the Start Menu

### RStudio
- navigate to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- click on the 'Download' button under the RStudio Desktop column
- download RStudio Desktop for Windows
- run the installer once downloaded, keep default options unless otherwise required
- test your installation by launching RStudio from the start menu
- `print("Hello World")` just for fun!

## Mac install:
### R
- navigate to https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/base/
- download `R-4.1.1.pkg`
- double-click the package to install once it's downloaded, and choose default install options unless you have specific reasons not to
- verify the install has been successful by opening a terminal and typing 'R' -- this should print details of the R version you are running
- `print("Hello World")` just for fun!

### RStudio
- navigate to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- click on the 'Download' button under the RStudio Desktop column
