## TRIG-R-Workshop : Course Resources

Hi team,

This is the repository where we'll upload code workbooks and resouces that we use during the workshops

Please read the setup instructions in the week 'Setup' prior to the first workshop. Key thing is to have a working installation of both R and RStudio

Each week will have some practical exercises and these will be uploaded to their respective weeks for future reference

We'll also use it as a central place to post a list of interesting resources/packages for people to explore in their own time.

Happy R-ing!
